# What's done
* Implementation of De Boor's algorithm for NURBS curves
* Splen building visualization
# Why is it done
For any one could understand - how De Boor's algorithm works
# How to test
1. Clone repo
2. Open in python IDE
3. pip install Pillow (link to drawing lib https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-pillow-basic/)
4. In main.py you can change contoll points and width/height of output gif window size. After runing main.py you will get de_boor.gif file, which is the algorithm visualization for current controll points  
# Example
