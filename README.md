# What's done
* Implementation of De Boor's algorithm for NURBS curves
* Splen building visualization
# Why is it done
For any one could understand - how De Boor's algorithm works
# How to test
1. Clone repo
2. Open in python IDE
3. In main.py you can change contol points and test algorithm. After runing main.py you will get de_boor.gif file, which is the algorithm visualization for current control points  
# Example 
![Пример 1](de_boor.gif)
